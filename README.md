Jewelry Website
Hello! I'm writing this as a template for a website I'll be building for my dad. I'm using this as a learning experience on how to write a site for a business. I'll be using everything I've learned so far from my studying from FreeCodeCamp and from The Odin Project. 

I'm excited to keep building on this and use everything I learn on this project!
